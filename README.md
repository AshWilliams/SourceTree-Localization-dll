# SourceTree-Localization-dll
After successfully decompile the SourceTree-Localization-dll from the Source Tree software, i was able to replicate the entire
assembly on Visual Studio 2012(C#); then i make a few changes to some texts, compiling the assembly from VS and replace the 
original dll with the new one; complete success, feeling like a cracker whoooo LOL.
